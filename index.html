                                        During my ML internship at Saildrone I focused specifically on accelerating inference on the ocean drones. By replacing the backbone of the RetinaNet (SSD model) with a ResNet-18 and
                                        pruning the ResNet blocks of that model by 50%, I was able to achieve a 3.5x inference time over the previous model. I utilized structured pruning at 50% by manipulating the weight matrices of the backbone modules in an 
                                        Object Oriented fashion. This model can now run in LOW POWER MODE in deployment environments, which is crucial since the drones operate on solar power, with FASTER performance than the previous model at HIGH POWER modes on Nvidia AGX cards.

                                        I'm currently improving a Mask R-CNN model I've developed for detection and segmentation of wildfire smoke, using PyTorch on a computing cluster at the San Diego Supercomputer Center. The goal is to minimize the damage dealt by wildfires by detecting wildfire smoke in less than five minutes upon ignition.
                                        We will deploy these deep learning models on Jetson Nanos, edge/embedded devices, at high-altitude weather stations to quickly detect smoke from great distances.
                                        I am happy to be working on using computer vision for the daunting task of creating a solution to the accelerating wildfire crisis in California. Currently, this model
                                        I am working on has an F1-score of 0.833! Meanwhile, more labeled data, approximately 3 times the currrent amount, will be coming in one week. This may potentially improve the model's performance
                                        by a sizable margin. I'll be sure to continue to post project updates.

                                        In Reinforcement Learning, one of the three major branches of Machine Learning, an agent can learn from interacting with its environment; learning from experience
                                        closely resembles animal and human intelligence more than any other branch of Artificial Intelligence. The Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) is a Deep Reinforcement Learning architecture for solving problems with high-dimensionality state spaces
                                        and continuous action spaces. Using 4 Dense Neural Networks, Actor-Critic methods, Experience Replay, and Polyak Averaging of Target network parameters, the agent is able to learn the value of actions in a given state and perform
                                        an optimal policy. This is my Python implementation based upon the 2016 ICRL Conference Paper "Continuous Control with Deep Reinforcement Learning", using TensorFlow and
                                        NumPy. I apply my implementation of the DDPG architecture on the
                                        OpenAI Gym's BipedalWalker-v2 environment. After only 1,000 simulated episodes, the bipedal walker learns the optimal amount of torque to be applied to each of its 4 joints across the state space to walk across
                                        a non-trivial 2-dimensional environment.

                                        As image recognition, object detection and other deep neural networks get more advanced, they suffer more and more from a lack of interpretability. Interpretability is a critical and often overlooked aspect of Machine Learning; how can we trust the models we build? The Deep Dream algorithm offers a technique for absolving the poor interpretability of neural networks, by visualizing into the notorious "black box" of these models.
                                        </br></br>
                                        Deep Dream uses Gradient Ascent to perform Activation Maximization, also known as Feature Visualization, in order to reveal the features that a given convolutional neural network, its layers, or even individual 'neurons', are looking for. By maximally activating the brain of the model, we get vivid visualizations of the learned representations.

                                       Cognitive Science specializing in Machine Learning and Neural Computation at UC San Diego includes a study of neuroscience, 
                                        calculus, linear algebra, statistics, and computer science. By wielding these scientific foundations, we can build Reinforcement Learning
                                        Agents, Computer Vision applications such as Level 4 Autonomous Vehicles, and much more. This motivated my continued pursuit of education at UC San Diego,

                        "We get it, you sleep." No, but really, sleep is important. Try to learn or read before bed. Our memory consolidation is best when a learning task is performed before sleep or early in the morning. Also, REM sleep is closely tied to emotion regulation, something neat I learned in a Learning and Memory class.

                                        <h3>Can Computers Dream? What does a convolutional neural network look for when it generates predictions?</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            Usually convolutional neural networks are black boxes; it is difficult to know if they're learning the features of your dataset that you would expect them to. Using TensorFlow and Tiled Gradient Ascent for Activation Maximization, we can answer the question:

                                            What do computers see? A computer vision neural network is akin to a brain that can only see, so what happens when we activate every neuron of the brain as much as we can? This is the result.
                                        </p>

                                        <h3>Internship: Detecting Wildfires using Mask R-CNN Pt.2</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            This is much better. The next step is to try an LSTM approach where our model can remember predictions of previous frames, instead of simply searching for smoke frame-by frame. To do so, I will start by developing a Faster R-CNN that will feed the
                                            outputs to an LSTM. The Faster R-CNN will perform the detection and create bounding boxes that outline the image we want to feed to the LSTM. The intuition is that feeding a sequence of images will reduce the false positives of our system and increase
                                            the precision by monitoring the development of the region of interest over time by including the relevant information of past predictions.

                                            It's a start. You see that the smoke is consistently predicted when it is there, but there are obvious false positives: clouds. Another issue is that non-maximum supression (NMS) is not removing other predictions on the same smoke
                                            because the Intersection over Union (IoU) is smaller than the NMS threshold. I either have to adjust this threshold or handle Mask R-CNN outputs with post-processing to favor the largest of the overlapping bounding box and segmentations.

                                            This is a recreation of a previous research paper for one of my upper division Machine Learning courses. This is a thorough performance analysis of 3 leading supervised learning algorithms on a binary classification task, performed across 3 UCI Machine Learning datasets.
                                            My study includes building GridSearchCV pipelines with sklearn to perform hyperparameter optimization and nested cross validation to find the best model parameters for each dataset and algorithm.

                                        <p>
                                            Using LAMP (Linux, Apache2, MySQL, and phpMyAdmin), we develop our very own MySQL Server that we can use as a Central Hub for various devices & applications. My project was the best in my ECE 196, an Electrical Engineering course,
                                            and will be used to teach future iterations of the course. This was a fun project to develop, with very exciting applications.
                                            I gave a basic demonstration and presentation of this project to my class; a link to the "Unlisted" YouTube recording is provided below.

                                        <h3>Arduino Microcontrollers for Restoration of a 1974 Toyota FJ-40</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            This is version of the base program I developed as a private contractor for restoring all windows and window functions of a 1974 Toyota FJ40. The code was developed using a custom made debugging shield for the UNO R3 Arduino board.

                                            This code programs the Arduino microcontroller to perform all the expected functions of a car window with a focus on the longevity of power relays. The window functionality includes the typical directional commands (up vs down), automatic rolling on quick press, and automatic killswitch from voltage delta or canceling press.

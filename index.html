                                        This technique can be used to identify what a neural network is trained to see, which can help to inform an engineer whether or not the neural network was trained to percieve the correct patterns in an image.
                                        In this example, I've repurposed this method to randomly generate an image from an inverted Convolutional Neural Network, by choosing the  Neural Network layers that
                                        interest me and feeding an RGB image of random noise into it. The program adjusts the pixel values with gradient ascent, such that the output of the layers
                                        will be maximized. Pretty awesome right?!

                                        My experience exploring this major at UC San Diego includes a study of cognitive systems, neural networks,
                                        calculus, linear algebra, statistics, and computer science. By wielding these scientific foundations, we can build Reinforcement Learning
                                        Agents, Computer Vision applications, and other highly complex deep neural networks that will self-driving cars, Netflix recommendations, voice assistants, and all the cool tech-y stuff that
                                        most people take for granted.
                                        </br>
                                        </br>
                                        Building an innovative product is easier than ever with this rising techonology. If you have relevant data, chances are, you can dream pretty big in the field of Machine Learning.

                                        </br>
                                        </br>
                                        Want to detect wildfires automatically by using cameras and previous videos of wildfires? You can use a detection and/or
                                        segmentation model that learns from patterns in the images of previous fires to identify where on the image smoke is pluming, before a human can see it. Neat, right? It would be nice to have less wildfires in California, <strong>or even none</strong>.
                                        At my current internship at the San Diego Supercomputer Center, we are building a solution to this very problem by developing Deep Neural Networks in PyTorch, with the intent to deploy them on edge devices at high altitude weather stations.
                                        </br>
                                        </br>
                                        Take another problem with less predictability and no past examples, like identifying every type of cell that exists in the brain of a mammal <strong>for the first time</strong>. Neuroscientists at UC San Diego are collecting the brain samples of rodents and using unsupervised learning techniques
                                        like t-SNE, UMAP, and hierarchical clustering to find patterns in the RNA-seq, methylation and chromatin accessibility to develop the first taxonomy of a mammalian brain. I was
                                        lucky to be a part of a small team of 2 other software engineers to build the data pipelines and visualization platform for the principal researchers to interact with.

                                        </br>
                                        This is my personal experience with my major in Cognitive Science and Machine Learning at UCSD. I haven't graduated yet; I'll finish my undergraduate degree in June 2021.

                        "We get it, you sleep." No, but really, sleep is important. Try to learn or read before bed. Our memory consolidation is best when a learning task is performed before sleep or early in the morning. Also, REM sleep is closely tied to emotion regulation, something neat I learned in a Learning and Memory class.

                                        <p>
                                            Usually convolutional neural networks are black boxes; it is difficult to know if they're learning the features of your dataset that you would expect them to. Using TensorFlow and Tiled Gradient Ascent for Activation Maximization, we can answer the question:

                                            What do computers see? A computer vision neural network is akin to a brain that can only see, so what happens when we activate every neuron of the brain as much as we can? This is the result.
                                        </p>

                                        <h3>Internship: Detecting Wildfires using Mask R-CNN Pt.2</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            This is much better. The next step is to try an LSTM approach where our model can remember predictions of previous frames, instead of simply searching for smoke frame-by frame. To do so, I will start by developing a Faster R-CNN that will feed the
                                            outputs to an LSTM. The Faster R-CNN will perform the detection and create bounding boxes that outline the image we want to feed to the LSTM. The intuition is that feeding a sequence of images will reduce the false positives of our system and increase
                                            the precision by monitoring the development of the region of interest over time by including the relevant information of past predictions.

                                            Its a start. You see that the smoke is consistently predicted when it is there, but there are obvious false positives: clouds. Another issue is that non-maximum supression (NMS) is not removing other predictions on the same smoke
                                            because the Intersection over Union (IoU) is smaller than the NMS threshold. I either have to adjust this threshold or handle Mask R-CNN outputs with post-processing to favor the largest of the overlapping bounding box and segmentations.

                                        <h3>Creating Our Own Raspberry Pi MySQL Server</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            Using LAMP (Linux, Apache2, MySQL, and phpMyAdmin), we develop our very own MySQL Server that we can use as a Central Hub for various devices & applications. My project was the best in my ECE 196, an Electrical Engineering course,
                                            and will be used to teach future iterations of the course. This was a fun project to develop, with very exciting applications.
                                            I gave a basic demonstration and presentation of this project to my class; a link to the "Unlisted" YouTube recording is provided below.
